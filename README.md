Angular-Routes-Solo

Hey everybody!

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3 fictional 
characters of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 
3 buttons to swap out the content of the characters.

Sample Characters

Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
Storm (X-Men)
Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
Samus Aran (Metroid)
Indiana Jones (movies)
Michonne (Walking Dead)
Feel free to use Google for the content, or make up your own! Include some images!

Hard Mode
Style your application with Bootstrap!

Pro Mode
Forget Bootstrap, use your own styles! Use a CSS reset for a clean slate first.
